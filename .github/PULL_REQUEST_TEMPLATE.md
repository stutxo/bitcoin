Before opening a pull request to Bitcoin Knobs, please first consider if it
is appropriate for Bitcoin Core or Knots and, if so, rebase it and first 
[open a pull request for Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare) 
or contact Luke in his Discord for Knots. Bitcoin Core has a strict and slow 
review process, but since Knobs is more focused on providing as many knobs as 
possible, feel free to request a merge of your Core PR into Knobs even while 
it's waiting on Core (or Luke to push for Knots).

<!--
Please provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves
Bitcoin Knobs user experience or Bitcoin Knobs developer experience
significantly:

* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.
* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or
  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover
  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests
  should accompany the change.
* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an
  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug
  was fixed.
* Features are typically welcome.
* Refactoring changes are never accepted in Knobs, and must be performed in
  Bitcoin Core.
