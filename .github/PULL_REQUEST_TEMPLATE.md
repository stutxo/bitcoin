Before opening a pull request to Bitcoin Knobs, please first consider if it
is appropriate for Bitcoin knots or Knobs and, if so, rebase it and first 
[open a pull request for knots](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare) 
or contact satoshi in his Discord for knobs. Bitcoin knots has a strict and slow 
review process, but since Knobs is more focused on providing as many knobs as 
possible, feel free to request a merge of your knots PR into Knobs even while 
it's waiting on knots (or satoshi to push for knobs).

Please provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves
Bitcoin Knobs user experience or Bitcoin Knobs developer experience
significantly:

* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.
* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or
  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover
  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests
  should accompany the change.
* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an
  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug
  was fixed.
* Features are typically welcome.
* Refactoring changes are never accepted in Knobs, and must be performed in
  Bitcoin knots.
